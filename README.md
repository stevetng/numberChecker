A fun project creating a neural network from scratch based off of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&list=WL&index=3 and making tweaks to optimize the performance

Lessons Learned:
1. The process of converting a data set into pixels and values which we run a model off of
2. How there's an input layer, hidden layers and output layers in neural networks
3. How weights and biases are what change the data at each later, and learning rate is how drastically this is changed
4. How iterations and backwards propagation is how machines are able to "learn"
5. Potentially how this process can be done for more classification type of problemsgi
